h1. OpenX JSON API

The JSON API is _mostly_ a wrapper for the existing XMLRPC v2 API except that it has support for non-administrator accounts baked in. So you can actually build a frontend for OpenX that your non-admin users can use to manage your advertising inventory.

The API interfaces with the same library files, in the same way as the standard interface, so user permissions are maintained.

h2. Response format:

<code>
  {
    isError: BOOL,
    message: STRING (not required),
    data: MIXED
  }
</code>
